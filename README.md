# Customer Insights Report

An ecommerce platform sells different types of products. The sales team is interested in using historical sales data to gain insights about the business. In this notebook, I use SQL to provide answers to the following questions:

1) Which customer placed the largest order of the product Chef Anton's Gumbo Mix?

2) Which salesperson brought the highest revenue in Q4 1996?

3) What is the total revenue from sales to customers in Mexico?

4) Which product has brought the largest revenue in q4 1996?
